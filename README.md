This repository contains the following tables and dataproducts from PISCO. 

Currently PISCO consists of **334** SNe in **286** galaxies and have run for **7** semesters (_Updated 2018 November 02_). However, data in this repo is for objects presented in the PISCO paper (272 SNe in 232 galaxies).

If you are interested in something in particular, please drop an e-mail to lluisgalbany at gmail dot com.

### em_lines

2D maps of fluxes (PRIMARY) and errors (EXT=1) for a few emission lines: Halpha, Hbeta, [O III] 5007, [N II] 6583, and [S II] 6719,31.

### figures

PDF version of the figures in the PISCO paper.

### local_sp

Local environmental spectra of 272 SN locations. Four columns: wavelength, flux, error, flag (3 masked wavelength, otherwise ok).

### properties

2D maps of gas-phase and stellar properties (PRIMARY) and errors (EXT=1): SFR intensity, Halpha equivalent width, luminosity weighted stellar age, Oxygen abundance in Dopita et al. (2016) and O3N2 Marino et al. (2013) calibrations, and stellar mass.

### tables

Machine-readable and TeX versions of Tables 1, 2, 3 and 6 of the PISCO paper.

### total_sp

Total integrated spectra of 232 SN host galaxies. Four columns: wavelength, flux, error, flag (3 masked wavelength, otherwise ok).
